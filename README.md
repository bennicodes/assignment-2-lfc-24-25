About the project:






Sources:
I used https://transfermarkt.com and https://liverpool.com to find info about the players.

Images was found on https://google.com and https://liverpool.com.

Icons were found on https://svgrepo.com and https://flaticon.com

For the flip/rotate animation on the player cards I used this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV8MVmtgmoY&t=244s&pp=ygUcY2FyZCBmbGlwIGFuaW1hdGlvbiBodG1sIGNzcw%3D%3D for inspiration adn guidance.
