# Liverpool FC

A simple menu which displays a list of web components which are in different states and shows how they work.

## Table of Contents

[Usage](#usage)
[Features](#features)
[Sources](#sources)

I chose these components because I feel like almost all of them are used in every functional website you can find and therefore highly relevant to becoming a good developer.

## Usage

Open the index.html file in your browser.
Choose wether you want to view the Premier League table from last year or view the squad by clicking the button/link, or pressing the link in the navbar.

## Features

Card flip animation

## Sources

I used https://transfermarkt.com to find info about the players and https://liverpool.com for inspiration for the footer design.

For the flip/rotate animation on the player cards I used this video for inspiration and guidance:
